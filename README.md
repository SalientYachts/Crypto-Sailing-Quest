<h1 align="center">What we have to offer:</h1>

Our project is unique to the blockchain.
It bridges the digital world with the fiat world using physical assets to give crypto a solid use case and real intrinsic value!

Yacht manufacturing and production:<br />
We have NFT Fractional ownership of the physical yachts. <br />
NFT holders earn rewards from yacht charters!<br />
So each NFT is asset backed!<br />

#Web3 Gaming:<br />
We have started development on our crypto and NFT based multiplayer Adventure Game. </br>
Players will be able to buy our NFT Fractional yachts and sail them (virtually in the game) to explore the ocean and various islands.
On each island are hidden NFT treasures and tokens, waiting to be found! 
(think Prince of Persia or Tomb Raider)

We will also host sailing races, where players can race each other to the finish line!
The in-game yacht speed and performance will be affected by the wind direction, sea conditions and tack angles.
Putting your virtual sailing skills to the test! 

<h1 align="center"> We will have an ALL-IN-ONE dApp! </h1>

				• NFT Minting section for each asset				
				• Rewards section showing the balances and claimable amounts
				• NFT smart contract Market place - specially developed for our NFTs
				• Users can buy and sell yacht shares anytime!
				• DAO for our governance program for overall governance and a DAO for specific assets governance
        

Additional features:<br />

The reward system (WIND) is tied to the fractional NFTs and earned in the game.<br />
The fractional yachts are chartered in real life and the proceeds therefrom are used to buy back WIND tokens.
The value is stabilized from the buying pressure we put on the market and by the burning of these tokens.
The physical yachts are insured, meaning that effectively the initial value of the NFTs is insured as well.


<h1 align="center"> Global expansions plans for both the crypto and real world: </h1><br />
Marinas with factories and service depots for our yachts, including housing and moorings, 
as an all in one holiday resort, in multiple locations around the world!

We offer Partnership Advertising displayed on the yachts at International boat shows (see the example on the next page)
